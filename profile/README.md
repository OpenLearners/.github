## Welcome to Open Learner! ðŸ‘‹

We are a small group of students passionate about programming and eager to share our learning journey with the community. Our main project is **TensorSANN (Super Awesome Neural Network)**, a machine learning library built from the ground up in C++ â€” with minimal reliance on external libraries â€” for the learning experience. 

As we dive into building **TensorSANN**, weâ€™re documenting everything along the way through tutorials and insights, so others can join us on this exciting adventure. 

Everything is a **work in progress** (WIP), but weâ€™re excited to share our progress and collaborate with the community!

Check out our prospective website here: [Learn-TensorSANN](https://openlearners.github.io/Learn-TensorSANN/)

Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
